#Hot or Not: Nashville Home Edition

This is my Ruby/Rails capstone project for Nashville Software School.
The app is a real estate game where you choose Nashville home listings that you think are hot or not.
The ones that you mark as "hot" get saved as favorites.
You can then edit those and email them to your realtor
if you're serious about house hunting or just play the game for fun!
